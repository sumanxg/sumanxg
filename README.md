<h3 align="left">Hey, I’m Suman 👋</h3>

I’m a Software Engineer building practical systems at the intersection of <b>AI, automation, and product engineering</b>.  
Based in Mumbai 🇮🇳. Obsessed with turning complex ideas into working code.

I work hands-on with <b>LLMs, Computer Vision, and applied Machine Learning</b>—not as buzzwords, but as tools inside real products, dashboards, and workflows.

I believe in:
• learning from first principles  
• shipping over theorizing  
• clean architecture > clever hacks  

When I’m not coding, I think deeply about psychology, philosophy, and how humans actually interact with technology.
