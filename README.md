<h2 align="left">Hi, I’m Suman 👋</h2>

<p align="left">
Product-minded Backend Engineer.  
I build systems that survive real users, real data, and real business constraints.
</p>

---

### 🧠 How I Think

I start with questions, not code.

- What problem are we *actually* solving?
- Who will maintain this a year from now?
- What breaks when usage grows?
- What’s the simplest system that still works?

I care less about frameworks and more about **systems that don’t fight their users or their developers**.

---

### 🔧 What I Build

- Backend systems for SaaS and mobile apps  
- APIs for users, orders, payments, and workflows  
- Custom CMS platforms for non-technical teams  
- B2B and e-commerce systems where reliability matters  

I enjoy owning things end-to-end: data models → APIs → deployment → production behavior.

### 🛠️ Tools I’m Fluent With

**Node.js, Laravel, Django**  
**PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL**  
REST APIs • CMS • SaaS backends • Mobile APIs

(Stacks change. Fundamentals don’t.)

### 🎯 What I’m Optimizing For

- Clarity over cleverness  
- Maintainability over shortcuts  
- Product outcomes over shipping for the sake of shipping

I’m interested in backend / product engineering roles where I can own systems and think long-term.
